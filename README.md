### Purpose & Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to draw on Citibike bikesharing data gathered from New York City in August of 2019. The dataset contains helpful demographic information, average trip duration, the most popular times to get a bike, and the kind of user (whether a generic customer or a subscriber), among other helpful data. Based on this data [a Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitibikeChallenge_16567013206560/CitibikeinNewYork?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) was created to visualize the NYC data to assist in replicating this business in Des Moines, IA.

### Results
Beginning with a geographical overview of Manhattan helps visualize the most popular starting and ending locations for bike rentals. Both starting and ending locations are heavily clustered to the south of Central Park. This suggests that there are perhaps locations or attractions which are highly sought after or disirable to visit.

Demographic data is key so as to offer a service to those who would really enjoy and utilize it. Not only do males represent the majority of bike users, but an overwhelming majority of the subscribers are males. Clearly, males utilize Citibike most often and are more likely to be paying subscribers of the service.
